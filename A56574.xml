            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Some of the Openings of that Life in them, and Pratlings of their Lips, as tender Babes in Chriſt Jeſus, are here preſented to be read in the Additional Epiſtles and Teſtimonies to what was before Printed.</p>
            <p>Many other precious Epiſtles and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies we have by us, which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to their Unconverted Friends and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, which at this time we thought not ſo meet to be publiſhed.</p>

Forever let it be had in remembrance of us, and of all thoſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33252:3"/>that truly fear the Lord; a Notable Day indeed! Verily the Devil Roared at it, and ſtirred up his Inſtruments to Blaſpheme this his holy Work; but in the Name of the Lord, We Defie him and them.</p>
            <p>Ah! dear Children, what may we ſay unto you? of ſome of ours that live in the Houſe with us, that were once wild and diſorderly, as well as others, but the Lord hath made them to Lament for their Sins, and I know they have repented of them, and the Lord hath been pleaſed to ſhew Mercy unto them, and now they love his Righteous Wayes; and the Lord hath filled their Hearts with his holy Praiſes; and hath alſo conſtrained them to write to their Relations that live in Sin, and do earneſtly beſeech them, <hi>To Repent of their Evil Wayes, and Defie the Devil,</hi> who is the whole Cauſe of the Miſery and Sorrow that falls upon the Sons &amp; Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of men, for tranſgreſſing the holy Law of God that is written in their hearts. Oh! how do they Lament over them, that they may come to Fear the Lord, &amp; walk in his Way with them, that they may be bleſſed

               <p>DEar Brother, &amp;c. the 24th of the 4th Moneth, 1679. we ſitting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Evening with the Family and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, being in all about Fifty, the Lords ſweet and tender heart-breaking Power
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:33252:8"/>was with us in a ſhower of abundance of Love, Mercy and Gentleneſs thorowout, which cauſed abundance of melting Tears, and great Soul-gladneſs, like unto the Love and Tenderneſs of a moſt tender Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in Forgiveneſs and Mercy, after Correction and Submiſſion under the ſame, I mean eſpecially as to ſuch who had been more ſtubborn: And the more mild and gentle-conditioned were under the pure ſenſe of the ſame Power in pure Love and ſweet Tenderneſs, with an encreaſe of what had been poured out before at the other Meetings: ſo that the whole Meeting and Family at that time was, as I may truly ſay, overpowered with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine comfort, in the ſenſe of God's pure Love; nothing elſe from God declared to them, but that they ſhould admire his ſweet Love and Mercy, and how good the Lord was, how gentle, kind, and moſt tender over them, together with the great admiring of the ſame Love, being filled with it; ſo that the heavenly Flame of it drowned all manner of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row at that time, and conquered all ſenſe of Terror and Judgment, nothing but Love, at that time, and Mercy appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:33252:8"/>and overcoming all; ſo that it was wonderful to behold the great Gravity and Senſe of the Children in ſuch an Exerciſe, there being ſuch a general Heart-breaking Power over powering them in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with Gods bleſſing throughout de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared amongſt them all. And now I may ſay, that there is not one who hath been of the worſt Temper and Diſpoſition hore at preſent, but in pleading with them about their Conditions, in the ſenſe of God's Truth, have been broken into a ſenſible acknowledgment with weeping Eyes; ſo far hath the moſt bleſſed Power of the living God appeared in this place, a Day much groaned and longed for to ſee, Glory to the Lord forever. And certainly the living God will beſtow more of his heavenly Bleſſings upon us, by the ſtill pouring forth of his heavenly Spirit, as we are dear and tender before him, and of his Glory, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So dear Brother, admire with us the excellency of God's pure Love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and pray with us, that we all may be kept in the ſweet and humble acknowledgment of all his moſt tender Mercies: And oh! that we may never give the leaſt occaſion,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:33252:9"/>whereby the Lord may with-draw the ſenſe of ſuch great Love and Mercy from us, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So dear Brother, if I could tell thee I would, how full of ſweet Melody my Soul is at preſent from the ſenſe of this his pure goodneſs, and how full of Joy and Gladneſs, and heavenly Praiſes: Oh! the glorious heavenly Power of the Lord God, how, when he pleaſes, it moſt wonderfully overcomes the Hearts and Souls of his beloved and tender Children! Oh dear Brother! feel, feel what my Soul can admire, but my Tongue far unable to utter, neither lawful for any man to do in this earthly Tabernacle, in which we reach unto thee dearly, and to thy dear Wife.</p>

                  <head>A teſtimony concerning the Goodneſs and Mercy of God our heavenly Father in Chriſt Jeſus, manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to the Children of our Family.</head>
                  <p>IN the ſence of the great Love and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mercies of the Lord God, who hath often graciouſly viſited and livingly refreſhed my Soul in our Evenings or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily's Meetings, I can and do bear this living and faithful Teſtimony, That at a Meeting the 23d of the 4th Moneth, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>June,</hi> in the Evening, the great God and Father of Mercy, in a ſpecial and wonderful manner, did abundantly pour forth of his good and holy Spirit of Life and Grace upon our Spirits, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour, by which our Souls and Spirits were broken and melted before him; <hi>That Waters did guſh out of of the Rocks, Springs were opened in dry places, and the very Depth did utter forth its Voice.</hi> I my ſelf was ſo overpowered and overcome with this heavenly Life,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:33252:10"/>Virtue and Power of God, that I did ſhake and tremble before Him the mighty God of Heaven and Earth, who by his quick and powerful Voice ſhaketh the Wilderneſs, <hi>and breaketh the Cedars of</hi> Lebanon, <hi>at whoſe appearance and look the Earth Trembles, and at whoſe touch the Hills Smoke:</hi> This his great Love and powerful Operation upon my Heart and Spirit, being livingly refreſhed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted by it, <hi>did cauſe my Soul to magnifie the Lord, and my Spirit to rejoyce in God my Saviour, ſinging and making ſweet Melody in my Heart to the Lord,</hi> becauſe he did ſo graciouſly anſwer the Deſire of our Souls, and powerfully break in upon the Hearts and Spirits of our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Children, revealing himſelf in his great and Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Power among them, in and through which their Hearts were broken, their Spirits melted, and their Souls humbly-bowed before him, as the alone ſearcher of the Heart, and tryer of the Reins, making known to every one his ſtate and condition, and bringing to Light the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den things of Darkneſs, and Counſels of the Hearts, which brought Sorrow and Trouble upon them, and cauſed many of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:33252:10"/>them to lament and cry out before the Lord. Oh! who can appear and ſtand before the great Judge of the Quick and Dead, and not Tremble at his Word, and not Howl and Cry as under the Senſe of his Judgments, till they be brought forth unto Victory, and the Soul comes to feel Redemption from Sin and Iniquity, through the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt!</p>
                  <p>We are living Witneſſes of this great and powerful Work of the Almighty God in and amongſt the Children of our Family, by which he hath begun to work out their Salvation with Fear and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and to turn their Minds from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto himſelf, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Forgiveneſs of Sins, and Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance amongſt them which are ſanctified by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, to the great comfort and ſatisfaction of our Souls, who was thus graciouſly pleaſed to appear and reveal himſelf in and among us, in his heavenly Power and Authority; for my Soul hath often been poured out before the Lord on their behalf, <hi>that he would be pleaſed to reach unto their Hearts in his heavenly quickening Power, that at length
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:33252:11"/>they might come to experience in themſelves what hath-often been declared to them by others, that ſo in the ſenſe of this Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking Power they might learn to fear him their Creator in the dayes of their Youth, and their Souls might be engaged and conſtrained to love and obey him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Lord hath heard our Cry, and anſwered our Deſire; he hath manifeſted his great Love, Favour and Mercy unto them and us, in the ſenſe whereof my Soul did and doth rejoyce, praiſing and glorifying his Name on their and our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half; I can bear my witneſs in Truth, that the ſenſe of the goodneſs of the Lord did reſt upon my Spirit all the Night long, that after I awaked my Eyes were full of Tears, and my Soul full of holy Praiſes and Thanks-giving unto the Lord, becauſe of his tender Mercies and great Love towards us, breathing to the Lord, that he in his heavenly bleſſed Power would carry on his great Work of Regeneration, that he hath begun in and upon our Spirits, and to Bleſs us daily more and more with all Spiritual Bleſſings in Chriſt Jeſus, to the Praiſe and Glory of his Grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath made us accepted in the Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:33252:11"/>according to the Riches of his Grace, wherein he hath reached and abounded towards us, to declare unto our Souls that he has pardoned our Sins, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us into his Fatherly Love and Care.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall I ſay of the next following Meeting? I am not able to expreſs the ſweet refreſhing Life, Virtue and Power of our heavenly Father ariſing in us with healing under his Wings. For as the Evening before, Fearfulneſs and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling came upon many, and Horror had overwhelmed them, ſo now at this time the ſweet Love of a moſt tender and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Father, embracing their Spirits, did ſweetly and livingly refreſh and comfort their Souls; he healed the broken in Heart, and bound up their Wounds with the Balm of his heavenly Life, Virtue and Power, to the great comfort and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of our Souls, who partook of the Water of Life, that the Lord poured forth and made us to drink of; in and through which the Spirit of the Humble was quickened, and the Heart of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite Ones revived.</p>
                  <p>Now as the Lord in thoſe two Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings hath appeared and revealed himſelf
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:33252:12"/>in and to us in a moſt ſpecial, gracious and powerful manner, ſo his Sweet and Heart-melting Love and tender Mercies have hitherto followed us from Meeting to Meeting ſenſibly and livingly, Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Comforting, Strengthening and Confirming our Souls in his Love, Life, Vertue and Power, until this very Day, Praiſes, Praiſes, Praiſes, Glory and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour be to our God, henceforth, forever and forever.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, it is ſealed to my Spirit by the holy Spirit of the Lord God, <hi>That We ſhall be Monuments of his Tender Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Fatherly Love and Care</hi> (Theſe are the Words which livingly aroſe in my Heart, as we were lately gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ariſe again as I am writing this Teſtimony for God) I ſay, We ſhall be Monuments of his tender Mercies and fatherly Love and Care, if we keep Low, Humble, Meek and Tender before him, he will inſtruct us, and teach us in the Way, which we ſhall go, and guide us with his Eyes, if we alwayes Fear and Dread his holy powerfull Name, which he hath revealed unto us, and pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth in and among us, as a good and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:33252:12"/>precious Ointment, which cauſes us to be glad and to rejoyce in him, and to love him with all our Heart, Soul and Mind.</p>
                  <p>In the ſenſe of this great Love and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mercies of the Lord God, my Soul deſires that I and every one of us, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially our dear Children, that have with us taſted of the good Word and Power of the World to come; by which our Souls have been quickened and livingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed and comforted, may be alwayes kept in a living ſenſe of the Lovingkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Goodneſs of the Lord towards us, that ſo we may walk in Humility, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Holineſs before him, who hath reached to our Souls, and made us ſenſible of our inward State and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and alſo of his Love, Grace and Mercy, that we may walk worthy of this his great Love, and Dread and Fear him in our Hearts, alwayes having the Eyes of our Mind towards him, that in his Light, ſhining in our Souls. we may ſee even the leaſt appearance of Evil, &amp; waiting in it we may receive Power to be kept and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of it, leſt by entring in or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to it we ſhould offend the Lord, and cauſe him to with-draw his ſweet
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:33252:13"/>Love, and to hide the Light and Favour of his Countenance from us, which would bring Sorrow, Anguiſh and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction upon our Souls. Oh! let us walk worthy of this great Love, let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of us be circumſpect in our Lives and Converſations, that our Enemies, who Reproach and Blaſpheme the holy Name and powerful Work of the Lord God, who hath graciouſly and gloriouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in and among us, may behold our Holy, Innocent, Upright Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and by it may be reached and convinced, that not the Devil, but the <hi>Lord God</hi> in his holy Life, Virtue, Power and Spirit hath appeared in and among us, by which he hath wrought a new Heart, and renewed a right and holy Spirit in us, the bleſſed Effect whereof is Holineſs and Righteouſneſs; which Work is not of Man, much leſs of the Devil, but of the Everlaſting, Pure and Holy <hi>God,</hi> who in his Everlaſting, Holy, Pure and Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Power hath begot us again into the heavenly Image of his dear Son Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, which conſiſts in Holineſs, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and Truth, which the Devil is out of.</p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:33252:13"/>
                  <p>Having therefore received Grace and Mercy, Life, Virtue and Power of God, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all Filthineſs of the Fleſh and Spirit, perfecting Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Fear of God, that we may ſhew forth the heavenly Vertue and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of him that hath called and tranſlated us from Darkneſs into his marvelous Light, and turned from Satans Power to his own Holy, Pure and Living Power, in which we are inabled to do good Works, new created of God in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works, that we may walk therein, in which if we are found walking &amp; doing the Works of God, we ſhall never fall again; for ſo an entrance ſhall be miniſtred unto us abundantly, into the Everlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who is the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the World, in which heavenly and divine Light, we daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Life, Virtue and Power, to eſcape the Corruption that is in the World through Luſt, and to live Soberly, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly and Godly in this preſent World, to the Honour and Praiſe of him that hath called us to Glory and Virtue. For this is the very end of the heavenly, living,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:33252:14"/>powerful Appearance of our God in the midſt of us, that in and through the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Power of his Son Chriſt Jeſus reveal'd in us, in his divine, heavenly Light, Life and Spirit, he might redeem us from all Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar People, zealous unto good Works; and that ſo out of the Mouthes of <hi>Babes</hi> and <hi>Sucklings</hi> he may perfect Praiſes for his Name. Let us therefore always be found in Well-doing, <hi>that our Light may ſhine before men, that they may ſee our good Works, and glorifie our Father which is in Heaven, who dwells in the Light, and is Light, in which, if we walk therein, we have fellowſhip with him, and one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son, which cleanſes us from all Sin,</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly known and felt, and the true Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the Father, and his Son Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt comes to be witneſſed, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Holineſs is ſhewn forth in our Lives and Converſations, by which our heavenly Father comes to be praiſed and glorified.

I being troubled and vexed in my Conſcience, by the grievous Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Judgments of God, did often times lie Howling and Crying in my Bed for one or two Hours together, ſo that ſometimes I could ſcarce ſleep, but as if I had been Tormented in the very Depth of Hell, and forever caſt out of the ſight of God, never to receive Mercy from him; but the Lord, full of Mercy and Love, did by degrees help me, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered me out of the Claws of the Enemy; and ſo by waiting more and more upon him, I became yet more ſenſible of my State and Condition, and did pray unto the God of Heaven, That he would teach me his Way wherein I ſhould walk before him in Singleneſs and Uprightneſs of Heart, and would alwayes preſerve me
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:33252:18"/>in his holy Fear. For as it is ſaid, <hi>A bruiſed Reed will he not break, nor the ſmoking Flax will he not quench, until he ſend forth Judgment unto Victory;</hi> this have I witneſſed in my particular. And again, <hi>They that wait upon the Lord renew their strength;</hi> this alſo hath the Lord made me a witneſs of: for ſometimes ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down in his Fear and Dread, with my Mind only ſtaid upon him, and waiting for his preſence, he hath melted my Heart and bowed down my Spirit before him, by the bleſſed in-breaking and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powerings of his tender Love, that ſo I could not but praiſe him and honour him, that in ſuch a gracious and bountiful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hath appeared unto me, and in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Love manifeſted himſelf unto me, and I have gone to my reſt in Peace with he hath brought me out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> wherein I was a Captive and a Bond-ſlave under the Prince of the Power of Darkneſs, with a deſire never to return back into <hi>Aegypt;</hi> for it is ſaid, <hi>They that go down into the Deep ſee the Wonders of God:</hi> So the Lord before whom I ſtand, knows I have a living Deſire, that I may alwayes be kept
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:33252:19"/>in his Fear, and walk worthy of the Love which he hath manifeſted unto me, and obey him, that ſo what I am, I may be to him, and alwayes may be kept Low and Humble before him, giving him the Praiſe, Glory, Honour and Renown, unto whom it belongs, now, henceforth and forever, <hi>Amen.</hi> So I reſt,</p>

                  <p>MY dear and true Love ſalutes thee, deſiring thy Well-fare: I have at this time writ a few Lines unto thee, which I hope may find thee in good Health. Foraſmuch as when thou waſt with us, the mighty Power of the Lord broke in amongſt us, and tendered our Hearts, ſo alſo it hath continued with us unto this day, which I deſire may never depart from us: I can really ſay, The preſerving Hand of the Lord is time after time witneſſed to keep us and preſerve us; and his intent is to do our Souls good, ſo that in him may be our Peace and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for ſometimes waiting upon him, in his bleſſed Light for his appearance, he doth ſo lovingly and fatherly appear, that he overcometh our Souls, ſo that we cannot but Praiſe and Glorifie him, that ſo graciouſly ſhould viſit us in his Love; as he ſaid, <hi>In the Day of my Power, my People ſhall be a willing People:</hi> And even at the writing of theſe Lines he hath
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:33252:22"/>broken my Heart before him: O! how is the Lord found of them that ſeek after him? How beautiful is he in his Ariſings? How doth he fill them that hunger and thirſt after him? Now are the dayes of Comfort come, even now are the dayes of Rejoycing and being Glad in the Lord approaching unto our Souls; for he that wounded us, hath in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure healed us; he that made our Hearts ſad, hath now cauſed us to rejoyce in him the Creator of Heaven and Earth; for who were we or our Fathers Houſes, that the Lord ſhould have reſpect unto us! but in his Mercy hath he done it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is my Deſire, that we may all be faithful unto the Lord in that he hath committed unto us, ſo ſhall we have more.

Preſence hath and doth ſtill follow us from time to time in our Aſſemblies, to our great Joy, I cannot but thank the Lord and praiſe his holy Name, for his care that he hath had over me, in bringing me amongſt
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:33252:23"/>them to be made a Traveller with them in that heavenly Truth which he revealeth unto us time after time, in and through his Son Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>For although I had ſome ſenſe of the Power of God before, and was really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced in my Mind, that the Way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have been brought up was the Way to Eternal Life to thoſe who were Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors of that Truth which they did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, and I did in ſome meaſure ſeek after the Poſſeſſion of the ſame; yet when I came into this Family, and amongſt thoſe Children, among whom God doth ſo wonderfully appear, I was made to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs before the Lord, that all that I had done was but very little in compariſon of that wherein I ſaw others exerciſed; and under the ſenſe of the ſame Power did I ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly cry unto the Lord, <hi>That I alſo might be made Partaker of that Power that did ſo fill their Hearts, and that he would forgive me my Sins, and blot out mine Iniquities, that I had hitherto committed; and that I might feel his Saving Arm to redeem me from the Bondage of Corruption, wherein I felt my ſelf deeply entangled.</hi> Which Cry I do really know was of the Lords own

                  <p>O! how is my Soul tendered, when I think of the Lords Love to my Soul, and how he hath delivered me from the Snares of the Enemy, who hath often ſought to captivate my Soul, and to hinder the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit of the Lord that would ſometimes ariſe in me! for then was he buſie to draw away my Mind from the Power of God, leſt I ſhould lay hold upon it, and thereby be delivered from him.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:33252:24"/>Life: And that if I would but give up to him he would Deliver me.</hi> Bleſſed be his Name forever. For by the Working of his holy Power hath he conſtrained me to give up unto him, and to caſt my ſelf down at his Feet, that ſo I might be ſaved by him: For even as he healed thoſe of their outward Infirmities, in the dayes of his Fleſh, who were caſt down at his Feet, and who humbled themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, ſo doth he ariſe in this Day, to thoſe who are willing to be humbled before him, and to give up truly unto him, with Healing in his Wings, to heal their Back-ſlidings, and to cure their Infirmities; and it is thoſe only who Humble themſelves before him, and who are willing to be content with that Meaſure that he is pleaſed to beſtow upon them, how little ſoever it be, that he doth Nouriſh, and that he doth Refreſh, even as he did thoſe two Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Old, one whereof was willing to be content with the Crumbs that did fall from the Table, the other was willing to be content if ſhe could but touch the Hem of his Garment: How was the Lord

                  <p>MY dear Love, in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Truth of the Lord our God (wherewith my Heart at this time is overcome) ſaluteth thee; ſo that in the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Senſe of the Heart-raviſhing Love of a Tender-hearted Father, witneſſed towards my Soul, am I conſtrained at this time to write a few Lines unto thee, ſhewing thee how wonderfully, and how powerfully the Lord hath made bare his Arm of Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and hath ſtretched it forth towards our Souls in this Place; in the Senſe of which my Heart at this time is broken, ſo that I cannot forbear, but muſt needs
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:33252:28"/>acquaint thee with that which I have ſeen with mine Eyes and heard with mine Ears, and my Hands have handled of the good Word of Life, ſince I came into this Family. Oh! my Mouth cannot ſpeak theſe things which I have livingly felt and experienced in mine own particular, neither can I expreſs thoſe things wherein I have ſeen others exerciſed, ſince I came amongſt them: for I have felt the Almighty and Powerful God at work in me, to the rooting out, in ſome meaſure, of that Spirit of the crooked Serpent that hath ſo long poſſeſſed the Houſe; but now have I felt the Cleanſing Power and Purifying Spirit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is come as a Refiner with Fire, and as a Fuller with Sope (and who hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, That he will have a Pure
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:33252:29"/>and Undefiled People to Worſhip him) to purifie and to cleanſe my Soul, in ſome meaſure, from the Polutions of Sin and Iniquity.</p>
                  <p>Oh, my Brother! my Soul cannot expreſs the wonderful Loving-kindneſs of the Lord God Almighty, which he hath handed forth unto me, in and through his beloved Son, who is come indeed that his Children might have Life, and that they might have it more abundantly: Oh! the flowings forth of his heavenly Life is felt in this Day to refreſh the Hearts of thoſe that wait upon him, and his heavenly Peace is witneſſed to comfort their Souls, which is more than Thouſands of Gold and Silver; and indeed, as one ſaid, <hi>A Day in his Court is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a Thouſand elſe-where.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:33252:29"/>
                  <p>Oh! this is the Day of glad Tidings indeed unto a Remnant, whom he hath reached unto by the Operation of his bleſſed Power, which worketh wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the Hearts of his little Ones, and of his tender hearted Babes, whom he tendereth before him, whereby they come to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Times of Refreſhment and of ſweet Conſolation to run down their Souls as a place of broad Rivers. Oh! my Soul at this time is ſenſible of his Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating and Refreſhing Preſence, whereby he hath often comforted me (to his Praiſe I can ſay it) and I know aſſuredly, that he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds nothing that tends to the good of thoſe that love him and that delight to run the Way of his Commandments, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him in the Regeneration,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:33252:30"/>but he enables them and endews them more and more with Power from on High, and he renews their Strength from time to time; ſo that indeed they can run the Race that he hath ſet before them, and not be weary, and walk in his Heavenly Way and not faint.</p>
                  <p>Oh! my Soul is ſo filled, at this time, with the pure Life of Jeſus, that I cannot but admire his Holineſs, who ſo filleth the Hearts of his Children with heavenly Praiſes and melodious Songs, whereby he makes them to praiſe and magnifie his Name in the Land of the Living. Oh! how can thoſe who are ſenſible of this his bleſſed Power, and of the Dawnings of his heavenly Day upon their Hearts and Souls, but forever praiſe and magnifie his Name for his bleſſed Appearance,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:33252:30"/>and for the Revelation of his holy Power, whereby he hath turned their Hoarts from their former Lovers, and from their former Idols, unto the Love of him and of his Truth, who is over all, worthy to be loved and waited upon. So having no more at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I do remain</p>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:33252:32"/>(who are in the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi>) and of their Children alſo, as they walk in his heavenly Way which he hath again revealed in this his glorious holy Day: O! the riches of his Love and the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitneſs of his Kindneſs towards all the Sons of men; but more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially towards them whom he hath gathered into the knowledge of his ever-bleſſed Truth, and in whom he hath revealed his Son, who are his Witneſſes on the Earth, whom he hath loved with a ſingular Love in his Son Chriſt Jeſus, and given him unto them to be their Leader and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander; and not only ſo, but he hath begun to viſit many of their Children in their Young and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Years, which cannot but be unſpeakable Joy unto all Upright-hearted Parents, to ſee and feel their Children viſited with the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:33252:33"/>ſame holy Arm of Power, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were viſited when they were gone far aſtray from the Lord; which to feel in themſelves is now their chiefeſt Joy: How much more then will their joy abound to fell it operate in their Children while they are Young and Tender!</p>
                  <p>And now for the Encouragement of all who rejoyce to hear of the Proſperity of God's Eternal Truth; I do teſtifie for the Lord, and to the Praiſe of his great Name, That the Lord our God hath not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn the Senſe of his Power and Heavenly Preſence, (as to the General) from us, in this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, but at all times many of us are ſenſible, as we are retired in our Minds, that the Lords Love is towards us; and we do alwayes feel his Power in our Meetings, whereby our Souls
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:33252:33"/>are refreſhed, and we are thereby confirmed from time to time, and in the Faith and Belief of the Proſperity of the Lords Work which he hath begun amongſt us: For notwithſtanding that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy may work at times in ſome of the Children, to draw their Minds into Wildneſs and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, yet the Lords Power is over all, and that contrary Spirit is much chain'd and kept down by the Revelation of Gods Heavenly Power, whereby a Remnant are kept in a bleſſed Meaſure, ſince the firſt time that they were thorowly reached thereby, and do grow in Weightineſs daily, and in the experience of the work of Truth in their Hearts, which is indeed great cauſe of joy unto all thoſe (of the Lords People) who are concerned in them.</p>

                  <p>OH! my Dearly Beloved <hi>Friends,</hi> when I was alone, and my Mind exerciſed in the Truth, this Cry came thorow me, That the Lord hath heard our Cryes, and hath bottled up our Tears, and hath anſwered our Deſires in a Bleſſing upon the Children, and hath broken the Wills of many, that they fear before him; and now is he fulfilling his Promiſe, and that bleſſed Saying; <hi>That Righteouſneſs ſhall Cover the Earth as Waters the Seas;</hi> that is, all over; for verily it cannot be ſaid, all over, except Young as well as Old come to know the Lord. And this is my Teſtimony, That the Time is at
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:33252:35"/>hand; for a bleſſed Day have we ſeen of the Lords pouring forth of his Spirit upon Young and Tender Children, that they may know him and fear before him. And I can ſay of a Truth, That we have of our Family, Children that truly fear the Lord, and do truly hunger after Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>O! how doth the Lord appear to us, in our Family Meetings, that we are overcome with his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Preſence, and our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Hearts broken before him, that they cannot contain from Praiſing his holy Name: His Glory doth ſo ariſe upon us, that our Meetings are indeed to Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: The Lord doth ſo follow us from Day to Day, and from Meeting to Meeting, as our dear Friends can witneſs with us; holy Praiſes ſaith my Soul, be to our God
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:33252:35"/>forever. Do we not read in the Scriptures of Truth, That Children in the dayes of Old have Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Name of the Lord, &amp; Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed at his People and Servants, and were Curſed forever? But now, bleſſed be his Name, he is appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Love and Mercy unto Children, that he may Bleſs them forever.</p>
                  <p>Ah! what the Lord hath done a few Moneths and Weeks paſt, that the like hath ſcarce been heard of in many Ages or Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions amongſt Children: My Soul deſires, that the Senſe of it may ever remain amongſt us, for we can never be able to ſpeak it forth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how Unutterable indeed are his Mercies unto us, and his Wayes paſt finding out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Oh! the Senſe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:33252:36"/>of this overcomes me, that all within me is conſtrained to praiſe the Lord, and magnifie his holy Name, for he is Worthy, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, Worthy, ſaith my Soul. O! how hath he broken in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us in our Meetings like a mighty Man of War, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hath been able to ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, but we have fallen down before him, with Praiſes and ſweet Melody in our Mouthes, that ſometimes we could ſcarce know how to depart to go to our Natural Reſt: And when we have been in our Beds, ſometimes our Eyes could take no Reſt for ſeveral Hours, we have ſo admired the Lord's doings with us.</p>
                  <p>The Lord hath Determined, That this His Bleſſed Work in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:33252:36"/>this His Day ſhall be a Preſident to the Ends of the Earth, that the Generations to come may Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie his Holy Name, who lives forevermore.</p>
